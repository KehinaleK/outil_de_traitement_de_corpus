Billy Batson was once Shazam, before he imprisoned a mysterious entity in the Rock of Eternity. In order to allow Billy to both guard the Rock and still be a hero, the demon Neron separated Billy and his empowered form into two different entities. Billy would remain in Hell to guard the Rock of Eternity, while Shazam returned to Earth to act as a hero, now without his younger self's innocence or conscience.
