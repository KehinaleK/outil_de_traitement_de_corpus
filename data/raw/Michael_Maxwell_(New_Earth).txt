B'wana Beast, Mike Maxwell, was a superhero of the jungle. He has the ability to merge the best qualities of animals into composite creatures with incredible powers, which he controls. His helmet, and an elixir he drinks, transform him into a taller and more powerful man than in his civilian identity as a ranger.
