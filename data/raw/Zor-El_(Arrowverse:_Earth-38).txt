Zor-El is the brother of Jor-El, the husband of Alura and the father of Kara Zor-El. He was a scientist in Argo City, before the destruction of Krypton. During the destruction, he sent Kara to Earth and helped save Argo, but he ended up being trapped in the Phantom Zone. Years later, Kara was sent to the Phantom Zone by Lex Luthor, where she found Zor-El. Eventually, they were saved by the Superfriends and Zor-El began living in Earth-Prime with a new identity; Archie.
