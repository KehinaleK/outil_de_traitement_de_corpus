Sara Lance is the daughter of Quentin and Dinah Lance; and the younger sister of Laurel Lance. She is also a former member of the League of Assassins known as Ta-er al-Sahfer, who eventually left the organization and became a vigilante in Starling City operating as The Canary, until she was killed by Thea Queen at the behest of Malcolm Merlyn. Later, after she was resurrected by her sister in the Lazarus Pit, Sara was recruited by Rip Hunter to join the Legends as The White Canary. She eventually replaced Rip as Captain of the Waverider and leader of the Legends, and married the former Time Bureau member/co-captain Ava Sharpe.
