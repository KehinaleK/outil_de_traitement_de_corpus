The Superman of the 853rd Century survived by becoming the living extension of the Sun. He left the Earth somewhere in the late 21st Century when everyone he cared about died. He traversed the entire DCU, going beyond time and space, and has been said to have reached as far as Heaven and Hell themselves.
