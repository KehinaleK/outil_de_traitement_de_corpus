Zari Tomaz was originally a vigilante hacker wielder of the Air Totem from the 2040s who eventually became a member of the Legends, but her life was altered by changes in the timeline during the Heyworld event. In the new timeline, she was renamed Zari Tarazi and became a socialite, who later joined the Legends with her brother.
