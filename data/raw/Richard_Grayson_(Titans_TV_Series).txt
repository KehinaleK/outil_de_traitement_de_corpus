Dick Grayson is a vigilante known as Nightwing, a founding member of the Titans, and a member of the Batman Family. His parents were the Flying Graysons, acrobats performing with him alongside in the traveling Haly's Circus. They were tragically murdered by a mobster in Gotham City named Tony Zucco, and the billionaire Bruce Wayne adopted Dick as his legal ward at a very young age. Grayson went through extensive training in martial arts and crimefighting to become the original Robin, Batman's sidekick. He was later succeeded by Jason Todd and Tim Drake as Robin.
