Sebastian Faust, commonly referred to as simply Faust, is the son of Felix Faust. Like his father before him, he is also a powerful practitioner of magic. Lacking a soul due to his father bargaining it away to a demon, he struggles to distance himself from his evil legacy and to prove himself a hero.
