Ayla Ranzz alias Lightning Lass hails from the farming planet Winath, she is the twin sister of fellow Legion of Super-Heroes member Lightning Lad (Garth Ranzz) and the younger sister of the villainous Lightning Lord (Mekt Ranzz). Ayla joined the Legion to honour her then-dead brother whom she's very closer to, even if it annoys her that Garth doesn't even realize when he's bossing her around.[1]
