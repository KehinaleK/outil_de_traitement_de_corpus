Crazy Jane is the dominant alternate personality of Kay Challis, who has dissociative identity disorder, with a total of 64 unique identities. As a result of exposure to the alien Dominators' "gene bomb," each of her 64 alternate personalities has a different super-power. While Jane initially believed that she was the only one without a metahuman ability, this was later proven false. She eventually discovered that she had the ability to heal others (whether this healing is primarily emotional or physical is unknown).
