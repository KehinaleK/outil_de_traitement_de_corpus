Barbara Gordon was the first Batgirl, a teenage vigilante inspired by Batman but also her foster father, Police Commissioner Jim Gordon. A life-changing encounter with the Joker made her lose the use of her legs, but she didn't let that stop her. Using her skills with the computer, she became Oracle, the premiere supplier of information for all heroes, and the founder of the Birds of Prey.
