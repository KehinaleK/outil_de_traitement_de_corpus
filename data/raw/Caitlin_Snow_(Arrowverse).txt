Caitlin Snow is a scientist at S.T.A.R. Labs and a member of Team Flash. She developed cryogenic powers and a alternate personality after her father used cryogenic research to freeze the progression of her ALS disease. After the Flashpoint, her persona Killer Frost emerged and become an enforcer for Savitar. Eventually, Caitlin has gotten herself and her powers under control and dropped the Killer, becoming simply Frost, until her personality was separated by Mirror Monarch and later killed by Deathstorm. She tried to ressurect Frost with the help of Mark Blaine, creating another personality named "Khione" instead; a god-like being with elemental powers.[1]
