The Batman (real name Bruce Wayne) is the vengeful and brutal vigilante protector of Gotham City, as well as the quiet and awkward head of Wayne Enterprises. He uses his expert combat skills and advanced gadgets to protect Gotham from criminals such as the Children of Arkham in an effort to make up for the sins of his late father.
