Rhea Jones, alias Lodestone was a member of the Doom Patrol with control over the electromagnetic spectrum. Sheer range of her powers made her an extremely formidable opponent, although this was tempered by her inexperience. She would later undergo a metamorphosis, and turn into an entirely new form known as the Pupa.
