Kong Kenan is the Super-Man of China. Initially a self-centered bully who cared only for himself, Kenan was changed after standing up to Blue Condor and receiving the powers of Superman, whom he greatly respects. Kenan is brash, headstrong and frequently rushes into situations without thinking, although he has the best of intentions.
