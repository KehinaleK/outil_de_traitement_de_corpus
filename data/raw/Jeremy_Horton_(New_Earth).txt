Jeremy Horton is a powerful telekinetic and telepath who went by the name Hard Drive. The main limitation of his telepathy is that he can't compel anyone to do something they didn't already want to do. He used his telepathy to become rich by securing business deals, and also to put together his team, the Young Heroes.
