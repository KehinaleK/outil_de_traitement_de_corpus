Renee Montoya is a veteran Gotham City Police Department detective who is friends with Commissioner Gordon. She blames Batman for the GCPD's job being so weird, mostly because he's let various children work alongside him as Robin over the years. She doesn't dislike Batman even though her interactions with his Robins often annoy her.[1]
