Michael Lane is a vigilante trained as part of a secret GCPD program to create a potential replacement for Batman. This experiment drove its participants insane and they eventually became the Three Ghosts of Batman, with Lane becoming the villainous Bat-Devil. The Order of Purity would later take him in as their agent Azrael, a deadly assassin working in God's name.
