Tyran'r was one of the earliest Green Lanterns and the only one alive in the present day. After Volthoom the First Lantern was defeated at the cost of five of the other original Lanterns, he volunteered to guard the mausoleum they were buried in. Gave up his power ring to Simon Baz, and is currently collecting the remaining five original lantern rings.
