Charley Parker was a teenaged orphan who idolized Hawkman and fashioned a set of wings to look like him. While the hero was called back to duty on Thanagar, the Matter Master accidentally transformed Parker into a being with wings called Golden Eagle who teamed up with the Justice League of America to reverse the effects.[1] Golden Eagle later joined the short-lived Titans West.[2]
