Oliver Queen was a famous historian, who sought in 1941 to rebuild his vast collection of Native American relics that had burned to ashes. In the process, he took up his bow for the first time to fight criminals. Deciding to continue with his actions, noting the heroism of then emerging hero Batman, Queen became the master archer known as the Green Arrow.
