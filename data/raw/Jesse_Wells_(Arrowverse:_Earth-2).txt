Jesse Chambers Wells, better known as Jesse Quick, was the daughter of Harrison Wells of Earth-2, and the speedster hero of Central City. Initially a human college student abducted by the metahuman speedster Zoom, Jesse gradually managed to unlock her Speed Force connection after being hit by a dark matter wave from the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator, later becoming a speedster herself and her Earth's superhero. Jesse briefly dated Wally West and helped Team Flash in their fight with Zoom and Savitar.
