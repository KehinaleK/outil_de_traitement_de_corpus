Jack T. Chance is a member of the Green Lantern Corps assigned to Sector 17, one of the worst, most troubled criminal sectors in the universe. Born of the hellhole Garnet, Chance's ruthless tactics earn him many reprimands from the Guardians of the Universe... but it's agreed that only a man as bad as he is could tame a sector as tough as the one he's been given. While other Green Lanterns wear a full uniform, Chance wears a trench coat, and simply sticks a pin with the Corps logo on his lapel. In addition to his power ring, he also carries a gun.
