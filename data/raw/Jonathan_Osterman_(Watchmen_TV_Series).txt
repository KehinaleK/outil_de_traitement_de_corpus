Doctor Manhattan (real name Jon Osterman) was a loving but distant godlike being who protected the United States from threats for years. Transformed by a particle test, he acted as a superhero, a scientist, and even created a new species, but eventually grew bored of being a god and hid among humanity with his wife, Angela Abar.
