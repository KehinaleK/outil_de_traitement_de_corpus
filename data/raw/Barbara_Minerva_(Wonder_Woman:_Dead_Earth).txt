After the world was destroyed in a battle between Wonder Woman and Superman, Cheetah was captured by humans who thought she had something to do with it. She was tortured and experimented on, and forced to act as a gladiator in a human camp for years, until she was saved by the returning Wonder Woman. She eventually returned the favor, helping Diana stop the monstrous Haedras and their leader, Queen Hippolyta.
