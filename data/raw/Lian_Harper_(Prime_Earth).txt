Lian Harper is the daughter of Arsenal and Cheshire. When she was a child her death was faked by Amanda Waller and she spent years being unwillingly teleported across time and space. She eventually ended up living on the streets of Gotham City, using the name Shoes. As a teenager she adopted the vigilante identity Cheshire Cat and was Catwoman's sidekick for a time, before finally reuniting with her father and her family Team Arrow.
