Mia "Maps" Mizoguchi is an excitable and curious Gotham Academy student. She is the founder of the academy's secret "Detective Club", which investigates the unusual and occasionally supernatural occurrences at the school. She idolizes Batman for his ingenuity and detective skills, and hopes to become his protégé as Robin. Maps also has a deep love of fantasy, exploration, and cartography -- the latter being source of her nickname.
