Zod is the "son" of Wonder Woman and Lord Superman. Actually a clone made from the shared genetic material, he was created in an attempt to broker peace on his Earth after years of war. Brainiac stole him from his parents and placed him in the care of the Kryptonian renegade Jax-Ur, who raised him as his own son.
