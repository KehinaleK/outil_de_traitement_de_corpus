Marcus Robbins is a member of The Freedom Fighters. As a black man, he saw his family and his people treated as sub-citizens by the Nazi regime, where black people received yellow numbered labels on their ears as if they were cattle and were recruited for low-skilled jobs as slaves, being usually treated very violently by their so-called superiors. Because of this he grew up a young man with desire for justice as the second Black Condor of the Freedom Fighters.[1]
