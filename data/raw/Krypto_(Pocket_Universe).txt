This incarnation of Krypto was born into Pocket Universe, a singularly created universe which was developed by the Time Trapper. That universe was part of Trapper's scheme to control the Legion of Super-Heroes after the Earth-One Superboy was wiped from existence due to the effects of the Crisis on Infinite Earths and replaced with the current Superman who was never costumed Superboy. Krypto was Superboy's kryptonian dog.
