Harvey Bullock was a detective in the Gotham City Police Department. Despite their different methods, he is a good friend and ally of Jim Gordon, and filled his place as Commissioner when he went missing.[1] He wound up resigning from the force due to a difference in priorities with the Gotham City mayor during the events of The Joker War.[2]
