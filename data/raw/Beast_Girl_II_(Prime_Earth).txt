Beast Girl (real name Kareli) is a young metahuman member of the Doom Patrol. Sometime after the Lazarus Event triggered a new wave of metahumans creations, the Doom Patrol began a campaign to recruit and protect the large amount of vulnerable and ostracized metahumans. Not long after, Kareli joined the team and moved into their new base, the Shelter.[1][2]
