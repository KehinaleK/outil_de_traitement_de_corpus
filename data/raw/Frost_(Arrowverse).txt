Frost was Caitlin Snow's evil alternate personality. After redeeming herself, she acted as a hero and a member of the Team Flash, possessing Caitlin whenever her powers were needed and, eventually, living her own life. After being hit by Mirror Monarch, she was separated from Caitlin, but was later killed by Deathstorm.
