Superboy, also known as Kon-El and Conner Kent, is a genetic clone of Superman and Lex Luthor. Superboy was trapped on Gemworld during the Flashpoint, resulting in a second iteration, a genetic clone of Jon Lane Kent coming to existence during his absence. Eventually, however, the original was rescued from Gemworld by his friends. The two versions of Superboy were later merged into one being. He has been a member of Young Justice and Teen Titans and eventually became the boyfriend of Miss Martian.
