Eve was one of the original humans created by God during the Dawn of Time. She was originally created to be the second wife of Adam following the banishment of Lilith, Adam's first wife. After Eve fled Heaven and came to Earth millennia later, she briefly rekindled her relationship with Lucifer and later became a bounty hunter along with Mazikeen of the Lilim, who would later become her wife.
