Commissioner James "Jim" Gordon was a detective in the Gotham City Police Department. After fighting numerous freaks and madmen, occasionally working alongside criminals like the Riddler and his nemesis, the Penguin to combat greater threats such as the Valeska twins and the Court of Owls, and leading Gotham City as best he could through crisis after crisis, he eventually became the police commissioner.
