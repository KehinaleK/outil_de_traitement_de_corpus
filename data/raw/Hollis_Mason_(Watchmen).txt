Hollis Mason was the first Nite Owl, a member of the Minutemen in the 1940s. Once a police officer inspired by the thought of excitement and adventure being a vigilante brought, Mason eventually retired to be a car repairman, and wrote a tell-all book about his former team titled Under the Hood. Soon after, he trained a successor Nite Owl in Dan Dreiberg.
