Beryl Hutchinson is the vigilante known as Knight, the third in the lineage of British heroes to use the alias. Originally, Hutchinson served as Squire, the sidekick of the second Knight Cyril Sheldrake, who himself served as his predecessor's Squire before her. Upon his death, Hutchinson took up the mantle, taking a new Squire of her own.
