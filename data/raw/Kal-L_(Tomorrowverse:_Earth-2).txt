Kal-L is the last Kryptonian, and the hero known as Superman. Unlike his Earth-1 counterpart, this version is a more adult one whose adoptive parents (Jonathan and Martha Kent) died in an accident; so he was raised an orphan. In World War II, he was an ally of the Justice Society of America, infusing himself under the code name "Shakespeare".
