Kara Zor-El is Supergirl, a member of the Justice League of the Li'l Leaguers universe, a timeline happier and less dark than the main universe. Kara is a sweet, polite and innocent child who is fond of streawberries and can not stand when her friends fight each other. Luckily their arguments use to be short-lived because her teammates are deadly frightened of her devastating sonic cries.
