Oliver Queen was the Green Arrow, a vigilante who after being shipwrecked and trapped for five years, trained to become a highly advanced fighter and master archer. Upon returning to his hometown Starling City, Queen at first fought crime in an attempt to right his deceased father's wrongs but, later, developed his own morals for defending the city in general. During the Crisis event, Oliver died protecting Earth-38, but was resurrected as the Spectre to defeat the Anti-Monitor, though the battle cost him his life.
