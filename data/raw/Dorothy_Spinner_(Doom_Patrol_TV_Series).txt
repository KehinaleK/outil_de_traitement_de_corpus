Dorothy Spinner is the kind but powerful daughter of Niles Caulder, and a metahuman with the ability to bring imaginary beings from her mind into and out of creation. Originally sweet and naive, Dorothy grew more mature and focused as she battled her most powerful friend, the Candlemaker, and bonded with the test subjects in her father's experiments in immortality, the Doom Patrol.
