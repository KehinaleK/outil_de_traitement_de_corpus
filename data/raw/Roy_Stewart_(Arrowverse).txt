Roy Stewart is a general in the U.S. Marine Corps and the step-father of John Diggle. When Diggle's father was a soldier, he died in a mission in Vlatava. Roy ended up marrying Diggle's mother and let John believe his father was a war hero, and John blamed Roy for his father's death, until Diggle discovered the true during the Ninth Circle's atacks.
