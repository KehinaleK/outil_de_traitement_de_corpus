Amenadiel is an Archangel of God, who was sent to convince Lucifer Morningstar to return to Hell, after Lucifer abdicated his throne and began operating a nightclub in Los Angeles. On Earth, Amenadiel fell in love with Dr. Linda Martin, and together, they had a son, the Nephilim Charlie. After his father retired, Amenadiel took his place in Heaven as the new God.
