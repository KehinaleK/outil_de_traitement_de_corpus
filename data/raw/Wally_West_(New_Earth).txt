 Wally West is the third Flash, a speedster from Keystone City who initially fought crime as the original Kid Flash with his uncle Barry Allen, the second Flash. He is a founding member of the Teen Titans and has also been a member of the Justice League of America. After he was struck by a bolt of lightning and doused in chemicals, Wally gained a mainline-connection to the Speed Force, meaning he cannot be cut off from its energy.
