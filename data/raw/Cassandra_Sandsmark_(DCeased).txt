Cassie Sandsmark, initially known as the superhero Wonder Girl, was a brave honorary Amazon and a member of the Teen Titans. She was one of the survivors who took refuge on Earth-2. Some time later, Cassie would take up the mantle of Wonder Woman, since her predecessor Diana had become one of the Anti-Living after being infected.
