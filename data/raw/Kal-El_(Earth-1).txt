Superman is Earth's first and premiere superhero, and its stalwart protector. Born Kal-El on the distant planet Krypton, he was sent to Earth as a child to survive Krypton's destruction, where he gained fantastic powers under its yellow sun. Raised to believe his abilities would one day put him in a position to help others, he uses his extraordinary superpowers to fight evil and protect the innocent. In his civilian identity he is Clark Kent, a mild-mannered reporter working for the Daily Planet in Metropolis.
