Alpha Centurion is a Roman superhero, who gained his powers from years of extensive alien training after winning games organized in honor of Virmiru by Emperor Hadrian. Due to the unique properties of intergalactic travel, he returned to Earth almost 2,000 years later, and became a resident of Metropolis, where he would meet Superman and became a trusting ally over-time, having developed immense respect for him.
