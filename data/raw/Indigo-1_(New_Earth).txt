Indigo-1 was the leader of the Indigo Tribe; the group that wields the indigo light of compassion. Unlike the other Corps, the Tribes does not have a traditional uniform. Instead she has tattooed the symbol of her Tribe all over her body, as do members of the Tribe. Indigo-1 and her tribe speak the Nokian language that is unknown even to the Green Lantern Ring, which is supposed to be a universal translator for every language. In addition to a power ring, Indigo-1 and her Tribe wield a coral-like staff that acts as their power battery and energy conduit.
