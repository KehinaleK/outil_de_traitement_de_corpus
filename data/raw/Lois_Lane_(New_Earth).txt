Lois Lane is a Pulitzer-prize winning investigative journalist employed at the Daily Planet. Raised in the military as the daughter of General Sam Lane, she is more than capable of handling herself in almost any situation, though this doesn't stop her from commonly being abducted by super-villains. She is the long-time romantic interest and eventual wife of Superman. She is also the mother of their son Jonathan Samuel Kent.
