Swinger was one of several convicts held prisoner in a United States army stockade in the early years of World War II. Lt. Benjamin Hunter selected the cigar-chomping Swinger to become part of a Special Forces unit code-named Hunter's Hellcats. Although lacking in moral fiber, Swinger faithfully served under Lt. Hunter throughout the remainder of the war.
