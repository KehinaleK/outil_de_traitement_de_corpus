Nora Darhk is the wife of Ray Palmer and the daughter of the H.I.V.E. leader Damien Darhk. After her father was killed by the Green Arrow, Nora was sent to Sumner Asylum and was possessed by the time demon Mallus. Years later, she inherited her father's powers and became a member of his cult to resurrect him and bring Mallus back. After Damien sacrificed himself to save her, Nora redeemed herself and joined the Legends, eventually becoming the new Fairy Godmother after taking over from the old one.
