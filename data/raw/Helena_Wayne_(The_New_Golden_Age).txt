Helena Wayne is the daughter of Batman and Catwoman from an averted future where her father was murdered as a result of the schemes of the time-traveling Per Degaton. She then joined the Infinity, Inc. and the Justice Society of America as the heroine known as the Huntress. As a temporal remnant of a future that is no longer possible, she exists as a living paradox on Earth 0.
