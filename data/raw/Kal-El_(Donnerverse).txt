Superman (real name Clark Kent, born Kal-El) is a noble, kind, and gentle Kryptonian superhero who uses his great power to protect the city of Metropolis, and Earth as a whole, from threats such as Lex Luthor, General Zod and the Nuclear Man. In his civilian identity, he acts as a mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet, where he works alongside spunky reporter Lois Lane.
