The Flying Fox is a former member of the superhero team the Young All-Stars,[1] who later gained employment with the hero-for-hire service Heroz4U. Though his performance was poor, the Flying Fox had little in life but his work, and remained with the company for ten years until it was shuttered by the arson of its headquarters in Metropolis.[2]
