Power Girl is the Earth-Two counterpart of Supergirl and first cousin to Kal-L, the Superman of Earth-Two. Power Girl took her cousin's place in the Justice Society of America after he entered into semi-retirement to focus on his personal life. Her survival of Crisis on Infinite Earths and adapting to a new world caused her some confusion as to her roots. She believed for a time she was descended from Arion, Lord of Atlantis, but following the Infinite Crisis she learned her original legacy still held true.
