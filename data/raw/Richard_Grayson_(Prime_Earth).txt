Dick Grayson is the adopted son of Bruce Wayne, better known as the vigilante Batman. Trained by the Dark Knight himself, Grayson eventually became Batman's sidekick, the first Robin. After Grayson outgrew his role as Batman's sidekick, he graduated to the role of Nightwing, donning a new costume, and, later, temporarily worked as Batman himself. However, after his secret identity was exposed, Grayson worked undercover as a spy for Spyral, taking the codename Agent 37, before returning to his role as Nightwing once again.
