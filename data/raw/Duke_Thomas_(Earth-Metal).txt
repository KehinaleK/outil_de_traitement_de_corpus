When Barbatos and his Dragons of the Bat attacked the multiverse, Duke Thomas hoped to save it. First he fled into it, trying to outrun their "Deathwave", but when he failed, he returned home and reunited the Justice League. The new League defeated the Dragons, at the cost of their lives, leaving Duke to be the Final Knight as the Deathwave collapsed everything around him.
