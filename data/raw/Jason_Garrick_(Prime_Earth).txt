Jason "Jay" Garrick is the first speedster to be called The Flash, and a founding member of the Justice Society of America. As a result of Doctor Manhattan's alterations to the timeline, Jay became trapped in the Speed Force and forgotten to all,[1] though eventually the alterations were undone and Jay was restored alongside the rest of the world's proper history.[2]
