Doctor Silas Stone is the strict and controlling father of Vic Stone who turned him into the superhero Cyborg to save his life after an explosion. A former S.T.A.R. Labs scientist, he used his abilities to keep Vic under his thumb, but as he saw how much that hurt their relationship, he softened a bit to be more easy-going and regularly assisting him on his adventures with the Doom Patrol.
