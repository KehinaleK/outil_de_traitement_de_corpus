Osul-Ra, also known as Red Son, is a young Phaelosian from Warworld and the adopted son of Superman and Lois Lane. He is one half of the Super-Twins with his sister Otho-Ra. Osul-Ra is sometimes known as the "Heir of Olgrun", as he carries a fraction of the power of Olgrun, first and mightiest of the Old Gods.
