Yz the Thunderbolt was Johnny Thunder's invisible pink anthropomorphic, thunderbolt-shaped magic genie, who can do almost anything if it has a human guide to steer it. In recent years, many other potential heroes have become the Thunderbolt's master, first Mike Dugan and later Jakeem Williams, who currently works with the Justice Society of America.
