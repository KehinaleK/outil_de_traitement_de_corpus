Bart Allen was a teenage speedster and a member of the Flash Family who went by several code names. He was born in the 30th Century, the grandson of time-traveling speedster Barry Allen, although he returned to the past to continue his family's legacy. Because of his strange origins, he aged at an inconsistent rate. Originally, he took the name Impulse to reflect his impulsive nature, but later changed his alias to Kid Flash when he grew older. There was a brief period when he became The Flash after Infinite Crisis, but he was killed by the Rogues during Full Throttle. Later on, he was resurrected during Final Crisis through his connection to the Speed Force and returned to his role as Kid Flash, before sacrificing himself during Flashpoint. Bart Allen was a member of the New Titans, Young Justice, the Teen Titans, and the Legion of Super-Heroes.
