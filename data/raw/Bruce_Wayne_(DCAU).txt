Bruce Wayne was the Batman, a tireless and cold vigilante with genius intellect and impeccable martial arts skills striving to make Gotham City a better place after losing his parents to petty crime. After initially working alone, he gained allies like Nightwing and Robin, and became a founding member of the Justice League. Years after having to retire due to old age, he trained the young Terry McGinnis as his successor.
