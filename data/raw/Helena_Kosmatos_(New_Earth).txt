The Erinyes (Alecto, Tisiphone and Megaera) granted 15-year-old Helena Kosmatos a portion of their power so that she could seek revenge on the Nazis who had killed many of those she loved in her Greek village. Escaping to the United States at 16, she used her powers as a member of the Young All-Stars. However, the Erinyes had not told her of the price of her powerâ€”when she became angered, she would be taken over by one of the monstrous Furies.
