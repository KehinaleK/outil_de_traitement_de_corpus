Hank Hall was the first Hawk. In contrast to his brother Dove who represents order and peace, he represents chaos and war. During Armageddon 2001, he became the supervillain Monarch and during Zero Hour he became known as Extant, one of the most powerful beings in the universe wielding the combined energies of both Hawk and Dove.
