Koriand'r is an alien princess from the planet Tamaran who lived in peace and happiness until her home planet was conquered. Banished from Tamaran, Koriand'r was enslaved and experimented on, granting her extraordinary powers which she used to lead a rebellion and liberate herself and her fellow slaves from their captors. She became known throughout the cosmos as Starfire, and settled on Earth, where she became a member of the superhero teams the Outlaws and the Teen Titans.
