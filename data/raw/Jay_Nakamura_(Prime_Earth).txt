Jay Nakamura is the boyfriend of Jon Kent and a Gamorran refugee living in the United States. He has a keen interest in journalism and activism, and anonymously runs an underground journalism site called The Truth[1] for an eponymous activist group he leads under the code name Gossamer.[2] Due to experimentation against his will by Henry Bendix, Jay is also a "post-human" with artificially created metahuman abilities.[3]
