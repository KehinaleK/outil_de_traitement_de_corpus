Gus (acronym for Genetic Unit Series 1) is the first Hybrid kid created by Dr. Gertrude Miller before the H5G9 virus pandemic. A year after his "father's" death, Gus decided to find his "mother" with the help of the former Last ManÂ Thomas Jepperd, which nicknamed Gus as "Sweet Tooth" due to his obsession with candies.
