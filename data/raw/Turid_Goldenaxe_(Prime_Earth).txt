Turid Goldenaxe, the Viking Judge, is an ancient warrior whose soul became trapped within her golden axe. Generations later, when the axe was passed into the hands of her descendent, her soul was placed in her body, allowing the Viking Judge to battle evil in the modern era as a member of The Unexpected.
