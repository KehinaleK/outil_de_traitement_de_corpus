When Garth, Ayla and Mekt crash-landed their spaceship on the planet Korbal, Ayla suggested that they could use the local lightning beasts to recharce the batteries of the ship. They were unsuccessful, and they were attacked by the beasts. The beasts caused the siblings to gain electrical powers. Garth was later at the founding of the Legion of Super-Heroes.
