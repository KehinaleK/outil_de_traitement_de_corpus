This version of Andrew Nolan is one of the Batch SW6 Legionnaires, a young version of the Legion's existing deceased Andrew Nolan introduced during the "Five Years Later" era. Batch SW6 were originally believed to be clones created by the Dominators, but later revealed as time-paradox duplicates engineered by the Time Trapper. The events of Zero Hour erased them and their adult counterparts, replacing them with the Reboot Legion.
