Captain Marvel is the World's Mightiest Mortal. Originally, he was an orphaned boy named Billy Batson, who was chosen by the wizard Shazam to be a champion of good. Shazam gifted Billy with the power of six legendary Greek/Judaic figures when he spoke the Wizard's name, transforming into an adult superhero. Later, Captain Marvel would gain the ability to share his power with Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr., creating the Marvel Family. Today, Captain Marvel remains as one of the world's greatest heroes.
