Carol Ferris is the boss and occasional love interest of Hal Jordan. Her family owns the Ferris Aircraft company, where she acts as an executive, and sometimes as a pilot. She is also Star Sapphire, a once villainous character occupying another part of her personality entirely. In the Star Sapphire Corps, where she fights for love across the universe, she has taken on a more heroic role.
