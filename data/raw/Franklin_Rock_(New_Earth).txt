Sgt. Franklin "Frank" Rock was the authority figure within his unit, Easy Company, during World War II. The unit was made up of a disparate collection of individuals who managed to participate in every major action in the European Theatre. Throughout the gruelling conflict, Rock developed a loathing for warfare but also creating a strong bond and deep sense of loyalty with the men of Easy Company.
